### Step-by-Step Guide to Clone a GitHub Repository

1. **Install Git**
   - **Windows**: Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation instructions.
   - **Mac**: Install using Homebrew (`brew install git`) or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
   - **Linux**: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian-based distributions.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt or Git Bash.
   - **Mac/Linux**: Open the Terminal.

3. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
     ```sh
     cd path/to/your/directory
     ```

4. **Find the Repository URL**
   - Go to the GitHub repository page you want to clone.
   - Click the green "Code" button.
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

5. ## **Clone the Repository**
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```
   - This will create a directory with the repository name and download all files.

6. ## **Verify the Cloned Repository**
   - Navigate into the newly created directory.
     ```sh
     cd repository
     ```
   - Check the status of the repository to ensure everything is correct.
     ```sh
     git status
     ```
